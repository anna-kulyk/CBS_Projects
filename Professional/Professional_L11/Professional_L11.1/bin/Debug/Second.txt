Something in here's not right today.
Paranoia's all I got left
Or how the pressure was fed
To have a voice in the back of my head
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that laughs every time I fall

That the face inside is hearing me

It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
