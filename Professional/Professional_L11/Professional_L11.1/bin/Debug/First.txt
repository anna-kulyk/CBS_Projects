"Papercut"
Why does it feel like night today?
Why am I so uptight today?
I don't know what stressed me first
But I know just what it feels like
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that watches every time I lie
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
Right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
